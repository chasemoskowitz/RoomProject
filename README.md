"# RoomProject" 

This project allows you to navigate through a house. You start at the front foyer, and you can go upstairs, into the kitchen, and other options like this. To do this, you must enter the number that correlates with the room. You do this until you enter -1 to quit. It uses validation loops to make sure the number you select is valid. The code employs OOP principles like inheritance, abstraction, and encapsulation. It alsos employs data structures like linked graphs, linked lists, and nodes.

To run, open the folder in Visual Studio, NetBeans, or whatever IDE you prefer. I created this project in NetBeans.
